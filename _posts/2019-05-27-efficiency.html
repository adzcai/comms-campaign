  In recent years, we've made significant changes to the way we present information with the introduction of OSA This Week, our Daily Bulletin, our Google Calendar, our Facebook posts and pages, posters, club advertisements, etc. If you're a minimalist like me, you might be thinking â€” wow, that sounds like a lot! Doesn't it get confusing figuring out what goes where?

  <ol class="platform-sub-points">
    <li>Instead, I will centralize data into an interactive site where all information distributed by SU and school clubs will be posted. This will make it much easier and more effective to access school information. I do not aim for it to replace the existing resources, but it will be a comprehensive page where all of the information can be found.</li>
    <li>Throughout the year, I also noticed that our main OSA Information group sometimes got cluttered with lost item requests, making it difficult to scroll through and find important information. To fix this, I will create a Google Form and a linked spreadsheet where lost items can be posted without extra clutter. This will ensure that we can keep important Facebook groups and other various streams clutter-free and efficient.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Have you ever faced the problem where you scroll past an interesting event on Facebook, but by the time you decide you want to go, it's been cluttered by requests for lost items or other event advertisements and you can't find the original post? Don't you wish there could just be a simple list or a calendar where you could find all of our school's events?</p>

<p>Well, that's exactly what I promise to do in my platform. As demonstrated by this site, I will use my experience with web technology to provide an experience that is easy to use and will allow you to easily find any information you need.</p>

<p>There are many ways that doing this will improve our school.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Less time spent scrolling through Facebook means more time to study or do schoolwork! By making it convenient to find information that you're looking for, I will save you valuable time you can use on more important things.</li>
  <li>No more miscommunication! The more places you can get information from, the greater the chances that one of them will be incorrect and cause mass confusion. Before you know it, everybody is frantically texting others the day before the event, and people don't show up because they had the wrong time! By making sure that all information provided is up-to-date and accurate, we can improve attendance at school events and create a more cohesive school community.</li>
  <li>In my last point, I mention keeping track of lost items. Let's be honest, our current system needs work -- our lost and found bins are often overflowing, and it's impractical to dig through each and every one of them when you're looking for something you've lost. By keeping a running track of what we're losing, not only do we make it easier for people who have lost their items to find them, but we can also return items to people who don't even realize they've lost something! This saves everybody from some pointless stress or confusion.</li>
