***Creating a NEW Future for OLD Scona***

Hello Olympians! Welcome to my campaign page. My name's Alex Cai, and I'm proud to announce my candidacy for the role of Communications Officer for the upcoming 2019-2020 year! This is where I'll be posting information about my platform in the upcoming campaign week.

Before I begin, I would like to thank all of you for making our school the amazing community it is today. I greatly appreciate the time you're taking to come and read about my platform. If you're here, that means you're planning to get involved in our school election (and hopefully consider my candidacy), and your involvement means I'm doing my job already!

The aim of our Students Union is to improve the lives of all of us students here at OSA. As a Communications Officer, my role will be to deliver information about our school clearly and effectively. In the platform that follows this brief letter, I will tell you how I will improve communication around our school and save you time one click at a time. In spirit of my minimalist beliefs, I have only three main pillars to present to you: Efficiency (Less is More), Interactivity (Make Involvement Fun Again), and Transparency (Everyone in the Loop).

With my significant programming and web development experience, I hope to introduce new technology to enhance our school's digital presence. I will program a Facebook Messenger Bot to provide information about events, clubs, and other school information, and gather all of our school information into a single comprehensive site where you can find anything you need, anywhere, anytime. You can read more about these projects in my platform [here](/2019/05/27/my-platform.html)!

As an ambitious Grade 10 student, I sincerely hope to be able to bring the best to our amazing school in the upcoming years. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and remember that your vote matters! Together, let's create a NEW future for OLD Scona!

Best regards,

Alexander Cai
