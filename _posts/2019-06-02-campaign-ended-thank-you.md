Hey Olympians!

I just wanted to let you know that the results are out, and I'd like to congratulate Trevor Trinh on being our Communications Officer for the 2019-2020 year!

The only regret I have about this week was that all of us candidates didn't get a picture together! This was the first time I've ever put together a campaign, and it was one of the most exciting and supportive experiences I've ever had.

Here's a long list of people to thank!
- To Elon Wang and Ainslee for the time they put into their testimonials;
- To all the people who told me they liked my speech or that they voted for me (even though it was supposed to be silent, haha) -- Thanks! I really appreciate it. I put a lot of work into my campaign and I'm glad you noticed it!
- To all of the other candidates for such an amazing environment to experience this journey in. It was truly an honour to run against all of you!
- All of the Grade 10s and 11s who came up to vote today to voice their opinion -- go democracy!
- You, for taking the time to read this, and being a fantastic person. Always believe in positive change, and you'll start to see it in your life!

Good luck on your upcoming exams, and I hope to be seeing you around! I don't think I'll be posting anymore on this page, except for maybe a photo of all of us when we take one. Have a great day, everybody!
