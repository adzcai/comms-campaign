Hey everybody! To start off the day, I have a testimonial from Elon Wang, a talented mathematician, chess player, and amazing member of our school's badminton team. Here's what he has to say about my candidacy!

> I knew Alexander Cai long before OSA; from numerous math competitions, math camps, and Asian parents. At the time, I only knew one key, undeniable fact about Alex: Genius. He was always the “smart kid,” and his many successes reflect his powerful problem solving skills.

> However, after meeting Alex Cai in person at OSA, I realized his successes come from not just intelligence, but from passionate, hard work. Anyone who knows Alex well can tell you he loves coding. He’s coding in his spares, during lunch, whenever he finds the time! I never seem to be able to catch him being unproductive, and his drive is unlike anyone else’s. If he were to be elected into communications, I can assure you his coding will not stop! He has already developed websites with cool features for his platform, and plans on revolutionizing the current communications through the use of programming.

> Welcome to a world where messenger bots remind you of your classes and automates confusing block switches, and where new and improved platforms provide updated information in a transparent way. Welcome Alex Cai, the hard-working programming genius, into Communications!

Thanks so much, Elon (on his behalf, I'd like to let you know that it's pronounced EH-lon, rhymes with melon)! He's right about my coding -- it's one of the hobbies I'm most passionate about and love to do. And for good reason!

It's undeniable that **technology is growing at an exponential rate**[^1]. I've noticed that we -- Old Scona as a school -- find it difficult to keep up with the times. While other high schools are experimenting with cool robotics projects, we barely have enough Chromebooks for the school!

Sure, you might say that it's because we don't have the budget. But **there's no reason we can't expand digitally** -- to a more modern-looking website (like this one), to new social media platforms, to new technologies that offer better communication with our student body than Facebook. That's why I'm running for Communications -- **to create A NEW Future for OLD Scona**. Because **if we don't get ahead, we're going to fall behind**.

If you want to see what he's talking about, feel free to check out my [GitHub account](https://github.com/piguyinthesky) to check out my programming, or [this game I'm developing](https://thepiguy-zero-hour.herokuapp.com/) for my Comp Sci course project! Thanks for reading this post everybody, and remember to come to the auditorium tomorrow for the election!

[^1]: Sorry to interrupt -- I just wanted to share [this cool (and kinda long) post](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) from the blog Wait But Why on the topic of how exponentially growing technology affects artificial intelligence. Read if you dare (or have some free time)!
