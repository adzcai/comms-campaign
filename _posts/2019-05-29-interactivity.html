  <p>Engaging with school events and our SU shouldn't be a chore. We certainly have a Facebook page, but unless you go to check it every so often, it can be easy to forget and miss events! Here's how I plan to use my programming experience to set me apart from other candidates.</p>

  <ol class="platform-sub-points">
    <li><strong>I will create a Facebook Messenger Bot that will notify members of the school when events are released, updated, or cancelled</strong>. A digital bot offers many advantages, such as always being available for any student to instantaneously contact, as well as having reliable information, and will lead to greater student engagement and decrease the amount of miscommunication. Students will be able to text this bot and request information about various events, to see what clubs they are currently registered with, or even to keep track of their timetable, etc. It will not only cater to students â€” It will also make it more efficient for different clubs to keep track of their member participation. I understand that there is a fine line of privacy at stake, so I will ensure that the user data shared with the bot is securely handled and only used with the owner's express permission.</li>
    <li><strong>I will promote and branch out our school's digital community</strong>. In my time as a Grade 10 student at OSA, I have discovered that many of us prefer other forms of social media to Facebook Messenger, such as Instagram, Discord, Slack, etc. Each of these platforms has their own advantages and disadvantages, and to cater to our student body, I will reach out to different platforms and ensure that every student has a way to communicate that they feel comfortable with.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Like I mentioned in the Q&A yesterday (go check out <a href={{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-05-28-one-step-ahead-of-the-game %}>my post about it</a> if you haven't), this section of my platform deals with the problem known as student apathy, or, in layman's terms, <strong>OSA students not caring about school events</strong>. The attendance for our events has been dropping over the past three years, and part of that is simply because of a lack of engaging communication coming from SU.</p>

<p>It seems obvious that this is an important problem. School events bring our community together and allow OSA students to bond with each other. What's more, a lack of attendance in interest in school events is also a negative indicator of our school's performance as a whole -- <strong>if people are uninterested, that can spread and have negative effects on our academic, social, and overall life as well</strong>.</p>

<p>Another important factor of student apathy is when students don't even know about the events because of miscommunications, which lead them to believe that our school doesn't actually have that much going on. But we all know that's not true at all! By making interactive notifications, such as through email or through a messenger bot, and keeping all event information organized on my website, <strong>I can solve our problem of student apathy one step -- one student -- at a time.</strong></p>
