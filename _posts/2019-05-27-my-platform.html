<div id="efficiency" style="display: none">
  <p>In recent years, we've made significant changes to the way we present information with the introduction of OSA This Week, our Daily Bulletin, our Google Calendar, our Facebook posts and pages, posters, club advertisements, etc. If you're a minimalist like me, you might be thinking — wow, that sounds like a lot! Doesn't it get confusing figuring out what goes where?</p>

  <ol class="platform-sub-points">
    <li>Instead, <strong>I will centralize data into an interactive site where all information distributed by SU and school clubs will be posted</strong>. This will make it much easier and more effective to access school information. I do not aim for it to replace the existing resources, but it will be a comprehensive page where all of the information can be found.</li>
    <li>Throughout the year, I also noticed that our main OSA Information group sometimes got cluttered with lost item requests, making it difficult to scroll through and find important information. To fix this, <strong>I will create a Google Form and a linked spreadsheet where lost items can be posted without extra clutter</strong>. This will ensure that we can keep important Facebook groups and other various streams clutter-free and efficient.</li>
  </ol>

<div id="interactivity" style="display: none">
  <p>Engaging with school events and our SU shouldn't be a chore. We certainly have a Facebook page, but unless you go to check it every so often, it can be easy to forget and miss events! Here's how I plan to use my programming experience to set me apart from other candidates.</p>

  <ol class="platform-sub-points">
    <li><strong>I will create a Facebook Messenger Bot that will notify members of the school when events are released, updated, or cancelled</strong>. A digital bot offers many advantages, such as always being available for any student to instantaneously contact, as well as having reliable information, and will lead to greater student engagement and decrease the amount of miscommunication. Students will be able to text this bot and request information about various events, to see what clubs they are currently registered with, or even to keep track of their timetable, etc. It will not only cater to students — It will also make it more efficient for different clubs to keep track of their member participation. I understand that there is a fine line of privacy at stake, so I will ensure that the user data shared with the bot is securely handled and only used with the owner's express permission.</li>
    <li><strong>I will promote and branch out our school's digital community</strong>. In my time as a Grade 10 student at OSA, I have discovered that many of us prefer other forms of social media to Facebook Messenger, such as Instagram, Discord, Slack, etc. Each of these platforms has their own advantages and disadvantages, and to cater to our student body, I will reach out to different platforms and ensure that every student has a way to communicate that they feel comfortable with.</li>
  </ol>

<h1><a onclick="toggleVisibility('transparency')">III. Transparency — Everyone in the Loop</a></h1>
<div id="transparency" style="display: none">
  <p>The role of a Communications Officer is to communicate information to our entire OSA family. To make sure that everyone has full information about upcoming events around our school, as well as other details such as house points, etc., here are some actions I will take.</p>

  <ol class="platform-sub-points">
    <li><strong>I will ensure that information about all events will be delivered to students across multiple platforms</strong>, including Facebook and through a Google Calendar, which will be easily accessible through schoolzone, our school website, etc., and will always be up-to-date with upcoming events. All other platforms will sync to this calendar to ensure that there are no miscommunications.</li>
    <li>A key component of our school environment is our thriving community of clubs of all sorts. <strong>I will remain accountable to all student and school-led clubs by staying in contact with club executives and keeping in touch about events and fundraisers</strong>. The club fair at the start of the year ensures that all students have information about the clubs they are joining. As the year goes on, many students decide to simply stick with one or two; however, this can lead to cluttered facebook groups where it is difficult to keep track of which members are truly active.</li>
    <li>As a member of the Students Union, one of my key roles will be to represent the student body. <strong>I will collaborate with Room Representatives and other SU members to promote ways for people to give feedback on events and simply everyday life</strong>, such as through Google Forms or conversations in person. This will help the Students Union make meaningful changes that will enhance the quality of life of students at our school.</li>
    <li>Using my experience with the Facebook Platform, <strong>I will be a responsible digital administrator</strong> for our Student Union groups and pages on Facebook and other social media. I will ensure that as much information as possible will be shared with as many people as possible across various platforms as mentioned previously, including important decisions made during our meetings and the results of school events, under the permission of our SU advisor and our school's administrative staff.</li>
  </ol>
