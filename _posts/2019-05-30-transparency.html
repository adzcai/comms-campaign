  <p>The role of a Communications Officer is to communicate information to our entire OSA family. To make sure that everyone has full information about upcoming events around our school, as well as other details such as house points, etc., here are some actions I will take.</p>

  <ol class="platform-sub-points">
    <li><strong>I will ensure that information about all events will be delivered to students across multiple platforms</strong>, including Facebook and through a Google Calendar, which will be easily accessible through SchoolZone, our school website, etc., and will always be up-to-date with upcoming events. All other platforms will sync to this calendar to ensure that there are no miscommunications.</li>
    <li>A key component of our school environment is our thriving community of clubs of all sorts. <strong>I will remain accountable to all student and school-led clubs by staying in contact with club executives and keeping in touch about events and fundraisers</strong>. The club fair at the start of the year ensures that all students have information about the clubs they are joining. As the year goes on, many students decide to simply stick with one or two; however, this can lead to cluttered facebook groups where it is difficult to keep track of which members are truly active.</li>
    <li>As a member of the Students Union, one of my key roles will be to represent the student body. <strong>I will collaborate with Room Representatives and other SU members to promote ways for people to give feedback on events and simply everyday life</strong>, such as through Google Forms or conversations in person. This will help the Students Union make meaningful changes that will enhance the quality of life of students at our school.</li>
    <li>Using my experience with the Facebook Platform, <strong>I will be a responsible digital administrator</strong> for our Student Union groups and pages on Facebook and other social media. I will ensure that as much information as possible will be shared with as many people as possible across various platforms as mentioned previously, including important decisions made during our meetings and the results of school events, under the permission of our SU advisor and our school's administrative staff.</li>
  </ol>

<p>The final point in my platform is transparency. What does the word mean to you? It's been thrown around so much in everybody's platforms that it's almost begun to lose meaning. Let's break it down. Here's what Google tells us:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>trans·par·ent</strong><br />
    <em>/transˈperənt/</em><br />
    <em>adjective</em>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>(of a material or article) allowing light to pass through so that objects behind can be distinctly seen.</li>
    <li>easy to perceive or detect.</li>
    <li><strong>having thoughts, feelings, or motives that are easily perceived</strong>.</li>
    <li>(of an organization or its activities) <strong>open to public scrutiny</strong>.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikipedia says:</p>
<blockquote>Transparency, as used in science, engineering, business, the humanities and in other social contexts, is operating in such a way that <strong>it is easy for others to see what actions are performed</strong>. Transparency implies <strong>openness, communication, and accountability</strong>.</blockquote>

<p>The main role of the Communications Officer is to be the connection between SU and the student body, so it's crucial to value being transparent.</p>

<p>To see why this is important, let's take a look at what's wrong with our current communications system. Even though SU meetings are open to the public, <strong>nobody feels involved enough in their school events and current issues to motivate themselves to attend</strong>. What's more, students don't know what each meeting is going to be about, so they don't know beforehand whether or not to invest their time by going. Some people might simply just not have the time outside of school!</p>

<p>Many other SU candidates have proposed methods to make giving feedback more efficient. But the truth is, social media makes giving open feedback extremely simple already -- typing out a comment barely takes a couple seconds. Is anonymity the problem, then, <strong>or is it once again the mean old beast of student apathy?</strong></p>

<p>To fix this problem, I believe that it's not just about making it easier to submit feedback. <strong>It's about making sure that that feedback gets heard and responded to, so that the student body can truly feel empowered to make a change</strong>. I promise that as the Communications Officer, I will work to make your voices heard, so that together, we can create <strong>a NEW Future for OLD Scona</strong>!</p>
