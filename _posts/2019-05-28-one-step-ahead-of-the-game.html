<p>First of all, thanks to all of you guys who came out to today's Q&A period! All of us candidates really appreciate your interest and engagement in our school's politics. To those of you who didn't come, here's a brief summary of my answers, or rather, what I <em>would</em> have said (I'm not the strongest public speaker)!</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <a class="show-button" onclick="toggleVisibility('question1')">What made you want to run for Communications?</a>
    
    <div id="question1" style="display: none">
      <p>Me: Well, when I first came to this school -- I mean, the first few weeks were great -- but as the year went on, I began to realize that our school has a pretty serious problem, like we mentioned earlier -- the problem of <strong>student apathy</strong>. Less and less people are coming to our events, and part of that problem is <strong>a lack of efficient communication</strong> between our Student Union and the student body. One of my personal traits is that when I see a problem, I am determined to go fix it, and I believe that my skillset of leadership and design coupled with my skill in web development and social platforms makes me the perfect candidate for this job.</p>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a class="show-button" onclick="toggleVisibility('question2')">What would you say is your worst and best trait?</a>

    <div id="question2" style="display: none">
      <p>Me: Hmm... I'm not really sure, it's hard to say...</p>

      <p>(That isn't what I meant to say, sorry if it sounded rude or arrogant! As you can tell, public speaking isn't my strongest trait!)</p>

      <p>I would say that my strongest trait is simply that <strong>I work smarter <em>and</em> harder</strong>, and coupled with my determined personality, it makes sure that when I get something started, not only do I finish it on time, but I can also to be proud of my work.</p>

      <p>That's what sets me apart. All of us candidates have fantastic backgrounds: we're all talented with design, we're all active on social media, and we all have a lot of really strong background in leadership and experience. What sets me apart is that, while a lot of the other candidates mentioned procrastination issues, <strong>I have great time management skills</strong> that let me spend time doing things that are important to me, like listening to you guys and working to make our school a better place.</p>

      <p>Of course, I'm not a perfect person -- nobody is! I admit that I have a lot of flaws, one of the worse ones being that at times I can be quite indecisive, and that I am usually very introverted in person. However, knowing what I need to work on is always the first step! I'm very active on social media, and by performing in our school's musical theatre program as well as speech and debate earlier in the year, I'm doing my best to make myself more approachable and open. Again, feel free to <a href="http://m.me/AlexCaiForComms">message</a> or <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a> me if you have anything to say or suggest!</p>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a class="show-button" onclick="toggleVisibility('question3')">What would you do if a large number of people suddenly stopped using Facebook?</a>

    <div id="question3" style="display: none">
      <p><em>Context: a lot of candidates before me suggested creating a website.</em></p>

      <p>Me: Well, you see, I'm already <strong>one step ahead of the game</strong>... I've already created my own site for my platform, which you guys are seeing this on right now! I hope it's demonstrating my experience with web development and programming by being clear to use and easy to find information on.</p>

      <p>Many other candidates advocated for using a Google Classroom to send push notifications to students' phones. While I agree that this is a fantastic idea, a website customized for our OSA needs is <strong>much more flexible</strong>, for example, and if the need arises, we can also multipurpose it for other things in the future while keeping its formatting <strong>clear and efficient</strong>. For you computer science people, it's kind of like another layer of abstraction; we can integrate other services such as a Google Classroom or Calendar into the website but not the other way around. This way, we can ensure that all information is <strong>easily accessible</strong> on <strong>reliable, official, centralized source</strong>.</p>
