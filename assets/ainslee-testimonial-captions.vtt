Hi Old Scona!

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.140
I'm Ainslee Fernandez and I'm here to tell you

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.240
why I believe Alexander Cai is the best

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.580
candidate for Communications Officer.

5
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.440
Aside from his hard work, dedication and

6
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.360
trustworthiness, he's also one of the most

7
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.380
experienced people I've known in regards to

8
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.080
technology. His campaign strives to create an easy

9
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.680
to access, reliable, and fun to use website that

10
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.720
can deliver us all the news from Students Union

11
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.300
and from OSA in general.

12
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.600
Alex is very up to date with the best technology

13
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.720
to use and knows his way around this particular

14
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.960
field quite well.

15
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.520
I've seen him do all sorts of things, from creating

16
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.240
blogs to designing

17
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.720
entire applications on his computer!

18
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.940
Other than his advantage of being well versed in

19
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.140
the tech department, he's truly one of the most

20
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.620
determined leaders I know.

21
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.360
He has many plans for the future that will

22
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.320
certainly be beneficial to us all,

23
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.340
and he is very passionate and making the school a

24
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.660
better place. I've gotten to know him quite well

25
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.940
over the school year, and I can say that without a

26
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.780
doubt,

27
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.600
he is one of the few people that I trust

28
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.100
completely. He's always open to listen to people

29
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.540
who need it, and either comforts these people in the best

30
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.400
way he can, or offers them helpful advice, which

31
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.540
makes him a kind and trustworthy person.

32
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.740
I'll end this by saying that there are only very

33
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.020
few people who have both the resources to make

34
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.400
our school an even greater place than before,

35
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.820
and the determination to push for improvement; but

36
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.040
I can assure you that he is one of those people.
