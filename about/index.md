# About Me

Hey everybody! My name's Alexander Dazhen Cai, but I usually go by Alex. I believe that you should know the person who's planning to represent you, so here's a little bit about me! Not the awards and stuff -- you can go check out [my CV](/cv) for that. This is just about myself as a person.

## Background

I was born in Toronto, but my family moved to Edmonton soon after and I've been living here ever since. I come from a pretty typical Chinese background: math, piano, all that jazz. I went to Catholic elementary and junior high schools, where I was top of my class and motivated myself to always strive for my best. As a result, I had the honour of attending the International Mathematics Competition in all three years of junior high, travelling to Thailand, India, and Bulgaria respectively, achieving Merit in both of the last two years.

Math is a pretty significant part of my identity. I've enjoyed solving interesting problems for as long as I can remember and looking for ways to apply it in everyday life. It's allowed me to meet a whole community of curious minds and have some of the most impactful experiences I've had in my life. 

## Hobbies

One of my traits that I'm pretty proud of is that I'm a bit of a jack of all trades -- I'm naturally a very curious person, and I love to learn new things, whether in school or otherwise. A lot of people are surprised at "how many things I'm good at," but really, I just don't consider anything a waste of time, so all of my time is productive (logic 101)! Here's a lot of things I like to do in my free time!

- As you can probably tell by the fact that I'm coding this webpage, programming is one of my favourite hobbies, specifically game development and web development. For the curious of you, I made this site using the static site generator Jekyll. The code is here on my GitHub if you want to take a look at it! 
- Even though most people don't think of me as athletic when they meet me, doing sports is actually a key part of my identity! I've been fencing competitively for about 5-6 years. I won silver in Cadet (U17) Mixed Sabre[^1] at the 2016 Canada Cup West, and have also won several local competitions.
- Music, as they say, makes the world go round. I began playing the piano at around 5 or 6 and am currently working towards my Grade 10 RCM Certificate, and the best part is, my parents didn't actually force me to do it (haha)! Playing music is a great way for me to unwind and get in touch with my sentimental side. I also play the trombone in our school band and the bass trombone[^2] in the Senior Edmonton Youth Orchestra. 
- After playing a lead role in one of my junior high's musical productions, I discovered an interest in the performing arts! Deciding to take Musical Theatre 15 here at OSA was one of the best choices I've made in my life -- I've had an amazing time rehearsing, performing, and having questionable conversations with the rest of the class. Shoutout to you guys!
- I'm an avid gamer, of many sorts.
	- I play a lot of video games like Minecraft and League of Legends, and I really enjoy them for the sense of community that you form by playing with a group or team -- well, maybe not so much in the latter game, haha -- and I'm really fascinated with their design. Those of you who know what I mean, my summoner's is Alexander2914 -- feel free to add me and maybe we can play sometime!
	- And the second type of game I play is board games and tabletop games, especially one in particular: Dungeons and Dragons. I first began Dungeon Mastering in Grade 9, and I was absolutely blown away by how simply awesome it is to run around in (or build) a fantasy world with friends. If you've never played, I highly recommend it! I also really enjoy tactical games like The Resistance/Avalon, Coup, Settlers of Catan, etc.

## Conclusion

Thanks for taking the time to get to know me! I hope I can get to know you better in the future. If you have anything you want to ask me about, campaign or otherwise, feel free to contact me [through email](mailto:a.cai6@share.epsb.ca) or through [Facebook Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/t/AlexCaiForComms)!

[^1]: There are three different types of fencing: sabre (which I do and is arguably the fastest and most exciting), where you score by hitting anywhere above the legs using any part of your blade; foil, where you stab them in the torso; and épée, where you can poke them anywhere (and is, no offense to any épéeists, kind of slow and boring). It's much safer than you would expect ([see this image](/assets/sports-injuries.jpg) -- it might take you a while to find fencing)!
[^2]: There's a few small differences: for a bass trombone, the bore (i.e. width of the tube where the mouthpiece goes in) is a bit wider, the mouthpiece is usually bigger, and the bell (where the sound comes out) is bigger. A bass trombone will often also have valves you press with your non-dominant hand to make lower notes available.
