	<p>Hey everybody! My name's Alexander Dazhen Cai. I usually go by Alex. Here's a little bit about me, since I believe that you should know the person who's planning to represent you!</p>
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>I was born in Toronto, but my family moved to Edmonton soon after and I've been living here ever since. I come from a pretty typical Chinese background: math, piano, all that jazz. I went to Catholic elementary and junior high schools, where I was top of my class and motivated myself to always strive for my best. As a result, I had the honour of attending the International Mathematics Competition in all three years of junior high, travelling to Thailand, India, and Bulgaria respectively, achieving Merit in both of the last two years.</p>
	<p>Math is a pretty significant part of my identity. I've enjoyed solving interesting problems for as long as I can remember and looking for ways to apply it in everyday life.</p>
	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>As you can probably tell by the fact that I'm coding this webpage, programming is one of my favourite hobbies, specifically game development and web development. For the curious of you, I made this site using the static site generator <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. The code is <a href="https://github.com/piguyinthesky/piguyinthesky.github.io">here on my GitHub</a> if you want to take a look at it! </li>
		<li>Music, as they say, makes the world go round. I began playing the piano at around 5 or 6 and am currently working towards my Grade 10 RCM Certificate. I also play the trombone in our school band and the bass trombone (subtle difference) in the Senior Edmonton Youth Orchestra.</li>
